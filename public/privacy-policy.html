    <p>
      Football Wordle ("we", "our", "this site") is a free browser-based word game for football fans.
      This page explains how we handle your data — in short, we collect none.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information.
      No name, email address, IP address, or device identifier is recorded by us.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Local storage</h2>
    <p>
      Your game stats (win streak, guess distribution, total games played) are saved in your
      browser's <code>localStorage</code>. This data never leaves your device and is removed
      when you clear your browser data.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      This site uses Google AdSense to display advertisements. Google may use cookies and similar
      technologies to show ads based on your prior visits to this and other websites. You can

      </a>.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-party services</h2>
    <p>
      Aside from Google AdSense, we do not embed any social-media trackers, analytics pixels,
      or third-party scripts that collect personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Children's privacy</h2>
    <p>
      This site is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect
      any information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy to reflect changes in our practices or applicable law. The
      "last updated" date at the top of this page will reflect any changes. Continued use of
      the site after changes are posted constitutes acceptance.
