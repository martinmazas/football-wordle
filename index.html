        <h2>About Football Wordle</h2>
        <p>
          Built by football fans, Football Wordle covers recognizable names from the world’s top leagues —
          Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1, MLS, and more. Lists are reviewed weekly
          during the season and updated after every major transfer window so each round stays relevant.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two modes: <strong>Guess players</strong> (famous footballers past and present) and
          <strong>Guess clubs</strong> (top-flight teams and competition participants). Both modes use the
          same color-hint mechanics as classic Wordle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your stats and streaks are stored locally in your browser only — nothing leaves your device and
          no personal data is ever collected or requested.
        </p>

          <li><strong>Type a name:</strong> use your physical keyboard or the on-screen keyboard on mobile.</li>
          <li><strong>Submit your guess</strong> and read the color hints on each letter:

              <li><strong>Green</strong> — correct letter in the correct position.</li>
              <li><strong>Yellow</strong> — letter is in the answer but in the wrong position.</li>
              <li><strong>Red</strong> — letter does not appear in the answer at all.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Use the hints to refine your next guess. You have <strong>6 tries</strong> per round.</li>
